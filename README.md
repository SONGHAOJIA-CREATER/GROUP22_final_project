# GROUP22_final_project

---

1. This project is an airport management system independently developed by students with the assistance of ChatGPT（Inspiration, bug fixing, etc.）.
2. This system does not utilize or copy any features or interface code from other open-source projects.
3. The data used in this project consists entirely of simulated data created by the students and is not real data.  
(Please note that there are still many features in this project that await further refinement or enhancement.)

This project consists of two parts: one is the `app.py` file (the backend server), and the other is a compressed folder containing all the frontend interface files. 

When using this project, you need to download both of these files to your local computer and then follow these steps:

1. Extract `fj3.zip` to a folder.
2. Place the folder containing all the files from `fj3` in the same directory as `app.py`.
3. Ensure that the following Python libraries are installed in your Python environment:
   - Flask
   - Flask-Bcrypt
   - Flask-JWT-Extended
   - PyMongo
   - Datetime
   - Flask-CORS
   - Dotenv
   - OS
   - Flask-PyMongo
   - Flask-Mail
   - Secrets
   - bson.json_util
   - pymongo.mongo_client
   - pymongo.server_api
  
   (If you do not have the above Python libraries, you can install them by entering `pip install <library-name>` in your terminal.)
4. After ensuring that all the required Python libraries are correctly installed, run the `app.py` file using your IDE or terminal.
5. Once `app.py` is running successfully, open `login.html` in the `fj3` folder to access the login interface. (If you are using it for the first time, please register for your own username and password.)
