# GROUP22_final_project

---

This project consists of two parts: one is the `app.py` file (the backend server), and the other is a compressed folder containing all the frontend interface files. 

When using this project, you need to download both of these files to your local computer and then follow these steps:

1. Extract `fj3.zip` to a folder.
2. Place the folder containing all the files from `fj3` in the same directory as `app.py`.
3. Ensure that the following Python libraries are installed in your Python environment:
   - Flask
   - Flask-Bcrypt
   - Flask-JWT-Extended
   - PyMongo
   - Datetime
   - Flask-CORS
   - Dotenv
   - OS
   - Flask-PyMongo
   - Flask-Mail
   - Secrets
   - bson.json_util
   - pymongo.mongo_client
   - pymongo.server_api
  
   (If you do not have the above Python libraries, you can install them by entering `pip install <library-name>` in your terminal.)
4. After ensuring that all the required Python libraries are correctly installed, run the `app.py` file using your IDE or terminal.
5. Once `app.py` is running successfully, open `login.html` in the `fj3` folder to access the login interface. (If you are using it for the first time, please register for your own username and password.)
